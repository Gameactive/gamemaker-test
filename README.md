# GameMaker: Studio Test
A repository to test compatibility between GitHub and GameMaker: Studio projects.

GameMaker: Studio has no native collaboration features. So with this repository, the idea is to use GitHub to store a copy of a GMS project directory, from which pushes and pulls can be committed on a per-resource basis.

So far, the following resource categories have not been tested:

• Sprites

• Sounds

• Backgrounds

• Paths

• Scripts

• Shaders

• Fonts

• Time Lines

• Objects

• Rooms

• Included Files

• Extensions

• Macros

The results will be written below as they are reached.
